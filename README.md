## üçâü•ù GLCM-Based Fruit Image Classification Project

### Description:
This project focuses on the classification of watermelon and kiwi images using a machine learning pipeline. The dataset was normalized using Z-score normalization, and feature extraction was performed using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) technique. The final classification was achieved using a Random Forest classifier.

### Key Features:
- Preprocessing of fruit images (watermelon and kiwi)
- Feature extraction using GLCM texture analysis
- Data normalization using Z-score standardization
- Model training with Random Forest classifier
- Accuracy evaluation and results visualization
- Implemented step-by-step in Google Colab

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Random Forest Classifier
- GLCM (Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix)

### Results:
Achieved classification accuracy on a limited dataset (7 watermelon, 7 kiwi images). This project can be extended to larger datasets for more robust results.

### Future Scope:
- Expand to multiclass fruit datasets
- Implement deep learning models (CNNs) for comparison
- Explore additional texture features for improved accuracy
